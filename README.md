# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This application features a real time work day schedule planner built with vanilla Javascript, jQuery, Moment.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts. Based on the current time that you are accessing the application, the time blocks will show a different color. If the time block is in the past relative to your current time, it will be grayed out. If the time block is in the same hour as your current time, the time block will be colored red to signify its urgency. If the time block is ahead of your current time, the time block will be colored green. Not only do the time blocks become colored based on your current time, but they also have customizable text areas where you can write down tasks for the day and save these tasks so you can refer to the planner later in the day.
